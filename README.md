Bodykit
=======

####_"Simplify, then add lightness"_  â€“ Colin Chapman



Bodykit is designed to improve frontend web development by providing abstractions of frequently used styling patterns. It's a build your own solution that can scale to fit various sized projects.

Some Assembly Required
----------------------
Bodykit is first and foremost a SASS tool set, designed to be style agnostic, and providing developers with pieces to assemble and paint as they see fit. It does not add a single line to your code until you've called a mixin or function, there's no defined classes, and no pre-generated code that you have figure out how to patch into your project. Installation is as simple as moving bodykit to your lib/sources folder in your SASS directory, and then importing it to your project.

     @import path_to_lib/bodykit/bodykit;

Top Mixins & Functions

Here are some of the top Mixins in Bodykit, each has directions for use, as well as details on any variables or caveats if applicable.

    ruby test.rb

Further Documentation
-------------

Bodykit uses [SassDoc](https://github.com/SassDoc/) for in-depth documentation on each mixin/function. To make use of this clone the repo to your local environment and checkout the gh-pages branch. You can then visit the page in your browser to see the documentation.
